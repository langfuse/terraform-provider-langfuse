# Terraform Provider for Langfuse

A Terraform provider for managing [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) resources programmatically.

Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform that provides observability, analytics, prompt management, and evaluations for LLM applications. This provider allows you to manage organizations, projects, and API keys using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## Features

- üè¢ **Organization Management** - Create and manage Langfuse organizations
- üîë **API Key Management** - Generate and manage organization and project API keys
- üì¶ **Project Management** - Create and configure projects within organizations
- üõ°Ô∏è **Enterprise Support** - Full support for Langfuse Enterprise features
- ‚ö° **Terraform Integration** - Native integration with Terraform workflows

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.5
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.24 (for development)
- Enterprise license key (if managing organizations and organization api keys)

## Installation

### Terraform Registry (Recommended)

Add the provider to your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    langfuse = {
      source  = "langfuse/langfuse"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Development

For development and testing:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/terraform-provider-langfuse
cd terraform-provider-langfuse

# Build the provider
go build -o terraform-provider-langfuse

```

## Configuration

### Provider Configuration

```hcl
provider "langfuse" {
  host          = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"  # Optional, defaults to https://app.langfuse.com
  admin_api_key = var.admin_api_key             # Optional, can use LANGFUSE_ADMIN_KEY env var
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `LANGFUSE_ADMIN_KEY` - Admin API key (alternative to `admin_api_key`)
- `LANGFUSE_EE_LICENSE_KEY` - Enterprise license key (required for admin operations)

## Usage

### Complete Example

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    langfuse = {
      source  = "langfuse/langfuse"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Variables for configuration
variable "host" {
  type        = string
  description = "Base URL of the Langfuse control plane"
  default     = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
}

variable "admin_api_key" {
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  description = "Admin API key for Langfuse (or set LANGFUSE_ADMIN_KEY)"
}

# Configure the provider
provider "langfuse" {
  host          = var.host
  admin_api_key = var.admin_api_key
}

# Create an organization
resource "langfuse_organization" "example" {
  name = "My Organization"
}

# Create organization API keys
resource "langfuse_organization_api_key" "example" {
  organization_id = langfuse_organization.example.id
}

# Create a project within the organization
resource "langfuse_project" "example" {
  name            = "my-project"
  organization_id = langfuse_organization.example.id
  retention_days  = 90  # Optional: data retention period

  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.secret_key
}

# Create project API keys
resource "langfuse_project_api_key" "example" {
  project_id = langfuse_project.example.id

  organization_public_key  = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.public_key
  organization_private_key = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.secret_key
}

# Output the API keys (marked as sensitive)
output "org_public_key" {
  value     = langfuse_organization_api_key.example.public_key
  sensitive = true
}

output "project_secret_key" {
  value     = langfuse_project_api_key.example.secret_key
  sensitive = true
}
```
